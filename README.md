## Deployment

This dApp is deployed at vercel: https://holesky-dapp.vercel.app/

## Notes

Extra features I was able to add: Pending tx tracker, transaction history (using local storage) and custom transfer functionality.

### Improvements for Later

Adding tests.
Supporting more chains.
Better UI for Recent transactions, sorting, filtering, etc...
